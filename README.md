# Week02-assignment
Image Gallery


(Required)
🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.


- One page, with a set of thumbnail images, and a larger image.

- Styled appropriately with CSS, and make use of media queries.

- Use client-side JavaScript to display the larger image when a thumbnail is selected.

- Use client-side JavaScript to navigate between images using the keyboard (tab, enter).


🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

1) Couldn't make the images change when keyboard left/right arrows were pressed down. Still works when you use tab/enter.

2) Did not attempt to create a voiceover / screen reader for image alt text.

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- 1) Couldn't figure out best way to make it work, tried using eventListeners but just couldn't make it work, I think i struggled with understanding where to declare what because of local and global scopes.

- 2) Did not attempt because I ran out of time.



(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.
 
What went really well and what could have gone better?
Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment. 

- Throughout the whole assignment i realised that I have basic knowledge of a lot of things but struggled to put everything together to make the logic of the project work how I need it to. The more code i added the more confused I got if something started not working.

-I understood how essential planning stage is, the need to describe what needs to happen and only then start coding, I also did not use some of the things I should have like conditionals and loops.

- Watched youtube channel "Traversy Media" which had a good Javascript crash course, helped with debugging my code.

- Had a lot of errors around scope of variables and functions, felt like I needed a lot more practice with functions, scope and probably loops. 

- Overall was a bit disappointed how well finished assignment looks and functions, but it highlighted where I need to improve.
